I'm an enthusiastic software engineer with a thing for clean code, smooth user experiences, and learning the “why” behind the tech.

Fresh out of an immersive software engineering program (lots of coffee, commits, and aha moments), I’ve been hands-on with:

🛠️ React, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS and APIs

🌱 Backend adventures with MongoDB and Postman

✅ Writing tests that actually catch bugs — thanks, Jest

🎨 Turning ideas into real, responsive web apps

🧠 Open to: collaboration, feedback, and exciting opportunities


Let’s build something awesome!
